## How It's Made
All problems are solved using Javascript

# Optimizations
I refactor and optimize my code for either efficiency, readability or both.

# Lessons Learned
I learned that I have a long way to go and that if I don't know how to answer a question that's okay- I can learn and understand how to solve it as there are many resources available online.
